# Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators (CS 236781) - Technion

This repository contains my solutions to homework assignments for the course "Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators" (CS 236781) offered by the Technion's Computer Science department.

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1

- **Introduction**:
  In Homework 1, we familiarize ourselves with `PyTorch` as a general-purpose tensor library with automatic gradient calculation capabilities. We implement traditional machine-learning algorithms and revisit basic machine-learning concepts, including different data sets, model hyperparameters, cross-validation, loss functions, and gradient derivation. We also explore other essential Python machine learning packages like `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `pandas`.
- **Grade**: 100

### Homework 2

- **Introduction**:
  Homework 2 involves the creation of a from-scratch implementation of two fundamental deep learning concepts: the backpropagation algorithm and stochastic gradient descent-based optimizers. We build a general-purpose multilayer perceptron, a core building block of deep neural networks. The assignment covers visualization of decision boundaries and ROC curves in binary classification and delves into convolutional networks with residual blocks. We design our network architectures, train them using GPUs on course servers, and conduct architecture experiments to analyze the effects of different architectural decisions on deep network performance.
- **Grade**: 99

### Homework 3

- **Introduction**:
  Homework 3 explores various aspects of deep learning, starting with text generation using a deep multilayer RNN network based on GRU cells. It then shifts focus to image generation with a variational autoencoder. The assignment further involves sentiment analysis, first by training a transformer-style encoder and then fine-tuning a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
- **Grade**: 100
